# High-Level Design (HLD) for Stock Price Monitoring Service

---

## 1. Overview
The Stock Price Monitoring Service is designed to fetch real-time stock prices, persist them in a database, and notify users via email when predefined price conditions are met. The system is composed of a **Client Service**, a **Server**, and a **Database**, with optional features like a frontend UI, advanced communication protocols, and security mechanisms.

This HLD outlines the system’s components, interactions, data flow, and high-level considerations to meet functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. System Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **Client Service**:
  - Fetch intraday stock prices for 10 predefined stock symbols using the Alpha Vantage API.
  - Submit fetched data to the server for persistence.
- **Server**:
  - Persist stock price data in a database.
  - Provide APIs to:
    - Allow users to set price notifications (e.g., alert when stock price exceeds or falls below a threshold).
    - Notify users via email when conditions are met, limited to once per hour per stock symbol.
- **Database**:
  - Store stock price data and user notification preferences.
- **Optional Frontend**:
  - Display stock price trends in charts.
  - Provide a UI to configure notifications.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple stock symbols and user requests efficiently.
- **Reliability**: Ensure data persistence and notification delivery even during external service downtime.
- **Security**: Secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, mTLS) and user authentication (e.g., SSO with Gmail).
- **Performance**: Fetch and process stock prices with low latency; ensure notifications are timely.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with clear documentation and tests.
- **Rate Limits**: Handle Alpha Vantage API rate limits (e.g., 5 API calls per minute for free tier).

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Client Service
- **Purpose**: Fetches stock prices and sends them to the server.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Query Alpha Vantage API for intraday stock prices (e.g., 1-minute intervals).
  - Support 10 predefined stock symbols (configurable).
  - Send fetched data to the server via HTTP or gRPC.
- **Considerations**:
  - Handle API rate limits by queuing requests or caching data.
  - Retry failed API calls with exponential backoff.
  - Log errors for debugging.

### 3.2 Server
- **Purpose**: Processes stock data, manages user notifications, and handles API requests.
- **Key Functions**:
  - **Data Ingestion**: Receive stock price data from the client and store it in the database.
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `POST /notifications`: Set price notification (e.g., stock symbol, price threshold, condition).
    - `GET /stocks/{symbol}`: Retrieve historical stock prices.
    - `DELETE /notifications/{id}`: Remove a notification.
  - **Notification Logic**:
    - Monitor incoming stock prices against user-defined conditions.
    - Trigger email notifications when conditions are met, respecting the 1-hour cooldown per stock symbol.
  - **Email Service**: Integrate with an SMTP service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES) for sending notifications.
- **Considerations**:
  - Use asynchronous processing for notifications to avoid blocking.
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.
  - Cache recent stock prices to reduce database load.

### 3.3 Database
- **Purpose**: Store stock price data and user notification preferences.
- **Proposed Type**: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data and strong consistency.
- **Schema (Tentative)**:
  - **Stocks Table**:
    - `symbol` (string): Stock ticker (e.g., AAPL).
    - `timestamp` (datetime): Time of price update.
    - `price` (float): Stock price.
    - `volume` (integer): Trading volume (optional).
  - **Notifications Table**:
    - `id` (UUID): Unique notification ID.
    - `user_id` (string): User identifier (from SSO).
    - `symbol` (string): Stock ticker.
    - `condition` (string): Condition (e.g., "price > 100").
    - `threshold` (float): Price threshold.
    - `last_notified` (datetime): Timestamp of last notification (for cooldown).
  - **Users Table** (if SSO is implemented):
    - `user_id` (string): Unique user ID.
    - `email` (string): User email for notifications.
- **Considerations**:
  - Index `symbol` and `timestamp` in the Stocks table for fast queries.
  - Use transactions to ensure data consistency.
  - Support for NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or time-series DB (e.g., InfluxDB) if scalability is prioritized.

### 3.4 Optional Frontend
- **Purpose**: Provide a user-friendly interface for stock price visualization and notification management.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time stock price charts (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js).
  - Form to configure notifications (e.g., select stock, set price threshold).
  - Dashboard to view active notifications and stock trends.
- **Considerations**:
  - Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.
  - Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### 3.5 Notification Service
- **Purpose**: Handle email notifications for price alerts.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Queue notification requests to prevent overwhelming the email service.
  - Enforce the 1-hour cooldown per stock symbol per user.
  - Send emails using a third-party service (e.g., AWS SES, SendGrid).
- **Considerations**:
  - Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for reliable delivery.
  - Log notification failures for retries.

## 4. Data Flow
1. **Stock Price Fetching**:
   - Client Service polls Alpha Vantage API for 10 stock symbols every minute.
   - Client sends data to Server via HTTP POST or gRPC.
2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Server validates and stores stock price data in the Database.
3. **Notification Setup**:
   - User (via API or Frontend) sets a price notification (e.g., "Alert when AAPL > $150").
   - Server saves notification details in the Database.
4. **Price Monitoring**:
   - Server compares incoming stock prices against notification conditions.
   - If a condition is met and the cooldown period has elapsed, the Server queues an email notification.
5. **Notification Delivery**:
   - Notification Service dequeues requests and sends emails via an SMTP provider.
6. **User Interaction**:
   - Users query stock prices or manage notifications via APIs or Frontend.
   - Frontend fetches data from Server and renders charts.
